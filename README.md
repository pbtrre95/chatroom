## Multi Chatroom

My chatroom project is a multiroom application where clients can communicate with messages. 
Each client has username, text colour and avatar. 
These can all be modified and each client is updated of the different changes that can occur.
The application was built using node and also used express, babel, socket.io and nodemon. 
The server side code is held in index.js. 
The index.html page will be the homepage where the user will select the chatroom they wish to join.
The relevant room code for updating the page where messages are displayed are held in the individual room pages.
